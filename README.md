In this assignment project I have worked on 25 Javascript projects which helped me understand JS much better and how to implement it.
Given below is the deatils of the corresponding projects :

1. Password Validator
Write a JavaScript program that checks if the entered password matches the confirmed password. If the
passwords match, the program should log "Password Matched. Password validation Successful." to the console.
Otherwise, it should log "Password didn't match. Password validation unsuccessful" to the consoleQ
