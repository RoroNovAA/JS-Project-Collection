# PWSKILLS-Milestone-exam
In this assignment project I have worked on 25 Javascript projects which helped me understand JavaScript much better and to implement it.
Given below is the details of the corresponding projects :

1. Password Validator
Write a JavaScript program that checks if the entered password matches the confirmed password. If the
passwords match, the program should log "Password Matched. Password validation Successful." to the console.
Otherwise, it should log "Password didn't match. Password validation unsuccessful" to the console.

2. Calculator
Create a javascript program that takes in two numbers and a string operator. Make use of a switch statement
to perform the operation on the two numbers.
The calculator function should: 
* Take in two numbers, num1 and num2, and a string representing a mathematical operator, operator.
* Use a switch statement to determine which operation to perform based on the value of the operator.
* If the operator is one of the four valid operators (+, -, *, /), perform the corresponding mathematical
  operation and store the result in a variable called result.
* If the operator is not one of the valid operators, log "Invalid operator" to the console.

3. Color Mixer
Write a JavaScript program that takes in two strings representing colors and uses a switch statement to
determine the resulting color when the two colors are mixed. The program should print the resulting color
based on the following criteria:
* If color1 is "red" and color2 is "blue" or vice versa, print "purple".
* If color1 is "red" and color2 is "yellow" or vice versa, print "orange".
* If color1 is "blue" and `color2" is "yellow" or vice versa, print "green".
* If any other combination of colors is input, the program should print "Invalid color combination".

4. Highest Marks
A teacher wants to find out the highest marks scored by a student in a class of five students. The teacher enters
the marks of all five students in an array called "marks". Write a program that iterates through the array and
finds the highest marks scored by any student in the class. The highest marks must then be displayed to the
teacher using the console. Make sure you use the ternary operator to find the student with the highest marks.

5. Capitalize
You are building a form where users can enter their names. You want to make sure that the first letter of the
name is always capitalized, even if the user forgets to do so. Write a program that takes in the user's name as a
string and uses the ternary operator to check if the first letter is lowercase. If it is, the program capitalizes it and
returns the modified string. Otherwise, it returns the original string without any changes.

6. Vowel Counter
We want to count the number of vowels in a person's name. Given a name as input, the program should iterate
through each character in the name, and check if it is a vowel or not. If the character is a vowel, it should be
counted.

7. Remove Duplicates
In an online shopping application, customers can add multiple items to their cart. However, sometimes
customers accidentally add the same item more than once, resulting in duplicate items in their cart. The
duplicate items not only make it difficult for the customer to track the items they want to purchase but also
affect the accuracy of the purchase order.
To solvd this problem, the application needs to remove duplicatd items from the customer's cart. The program
should take the customer's cart with duplicates as input, and return a new cart without duplicates.
Write a program to solve thd problem of duplicate items in the cart by removing duplicates.

8. Inverted right-angled triangle pattern with asterisks
Write a program that takes an integer input i and prints an inverted right-angled triangle pattern of asterisks
with i rows.
Inverted right-angled pattern:

If i=6.

9. Check for divisibility.
Write a program that takes an array of numbers and prints all thd numbers that ard divisible by 3, but not by 2.
Use a for loop and continue statement.

10. Correct a bug
You are working on an e-commerce website where customers can add items to their cart. The cart stores the
quantity of each item that the customer wants to purchase in an array of numbers. However, the website is
currently experiencing a bug where the quantity of each item is being recorded incorrectly by reducing it to
half. As a result, you need to write a JavaScript function that can double the quantity of each item in the cart
array to correct the bug.

11. Unit converter
A local weather station needs to convert temperature data collected in Celsius to Fahrenheit before displaying
it on its website. They want a function that can convert Celsius to Fahrenheit accurately and efficiently. The
function should take input in Celsius and return output in Fahrenheit. This function will help the weather station
to provide temperature readings that are easily understandable to a wider audience.
